Quickstart Guide
================


Install ncbi-blast+
---------------------
**Do this before running Prokka**

Prokka requires makeblastdb version >= 2.8. Unfortunately if you are on Ubuntu
you can only install version 2.6 using :code:`sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+`
so regardless of your operating system you will want to head to 
`NCBI FTP server <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/>`_
to download the latest version and place it somewhere so it is executable. If
you are having problems doing this, here is a `good link to check out <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere>`_
(Sorry windows people). Test by typing :code:`makeblastdb --help` in your terminal.
You should get the help menu.



Install Prokka with Sudo Privlages
--------------------
Note: I installed Prokka for Ubuntu but it looks like the steps for Mac are
prety similar. Hopefully this is helpful.

1. `Visit the GitHub and follow their install directions <https://github.com/tseemann/prokka>`_

.. note::  I ran the last command from my home directory. I am pretty sure Prokka sets itself up where you run that last command.

2. Test to make sure Prokka is responsive. My commands to do so look like below.

.. note::  Your file paths may look different than mine.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   cd
   cd prokka/bin
   ./prokka --help

This should print the help menu if everything is working. 

Calling tree from the prokka folder in my home directory this is the directory
structure I got. 

.. code-block:: text

Install Prokka without Sudo Privlages
--------------------------------------
Still working on that one. I tried cloning it onto the comp bio server
and running but got some errors about compilation.
